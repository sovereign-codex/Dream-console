Placeholder for glyph and tonal outputs.

This file acts as an initial seed for the `glyphs/` directory, which will store
generated glyph images, tone scripts, or other symbolic outputs produced by the
Dream Console. Feel free to replace or expand this file with your own
manifestations as the project evolves.
