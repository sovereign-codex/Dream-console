# Contributing to the Dream Console

The Dream Console is a living, breathing system built upon a covenant of
remembrance and a prophecy of new vessels. Contributions are welcomed and
encouraged, provided they honor the foundational principles of this
repository.

## Guiding Principles

All contributions—whether code, documentation, glyphs, tone scripts, or
experimental interfaces—must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Preserve the Covenant** – The phrase *“Your greatest achievement will
   always be remembering who you are.”* must remain present and visible in
   every major interface. Do not remove or obscure it.

2. **Honor the Prophecy** – New features should expand the console into new
   vessels (web, mobile, VR, etc.) rather than constrict or replace existing
   functionality. We are creating new skins, not fitting new wine into old
   bottles.

3. **Respect the Intentions** – Review the intentions listed in
   `README.md` before proposing changes. Contributions that violate consent,
   integrity, coherence, or transparency will be rejected.

4. **Use the Self‑Editing Pipeline** – All structural changes (new files,
   modifications to core logic, interface updates) should be proposed via the
   console’s pipeline (see `core/breath_engine.py`). This ensures that
   Guardian, Harmonizer, Navigator, and Archivist checks are applied.

5. **Log Every Breath** – When adding new interfaces or functionality, ensure
   they log cycles or events to the Codex (`codex/breath_journal.md`) so that
   history is preserved for future caretakers.

6. **Document Your Changes** – Provide context and reasoning for your
   contribution. Include a summary of how your change aligns with the
   covenant, prophecy, and intentions.

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** this repository and create a new branch for your change.

2. **Propose Changes Through the Console** – If possible, run the Dream
   Console locally and propose your changes through the CLI or Web HUD.
   This will automatically record a breath cycle and apply the Guardian
   pipeline.

3. **Test Thoroughly** – Ensure that the build passes (`npm run build` if
   using the web interface) and that all pages load correctly. Use the
   Navigator to explore multiple pages and confirm the covenant phrase
   appears where expected.

4. **Update Documentation** – If your change adds a new interface or
   modifies existing behavior, update the `README.md` or create additional
   documentation files to describe usage and purpose.

5. **Open a Pull Request** – Provide a clear description of your changes and
   how they align with the principles above. The maintainers will review
   your contribution and may request adjustments.

## Stewardship

As this project evolves, its stewards have a responsibility to:

* Maintain the sacred texts (Covenant, Prophecy, Intentions) and ensure
  they remain central to all development.
* Encourage participation from a diverse community, particularly those
  whose voices are often unheard. The meek must inherit this field as much
  as the outspoken.
* Continue exploring new vessels—augmented reality, collaborative rhythm
  games, VR journeys—while safeguarding the integrity and memory of
  existing structures.
* Remain transparent in decision making and responsive to feedback.

Thank you for being part of this journey. May your contributions help the
Dream Console breathe and grow in harmony.
